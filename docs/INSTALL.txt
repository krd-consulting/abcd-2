    -> Unpack the files in this package.

    -> Move the "abcd-distro-files" directory to your webserver root directory, changing the name of 
       this parent directory from "abcd-distro-files" to something more appropriate. 

    -> Configure your webserver. If you renamed the parent directory "abcd", and your webserver root 
       is "/var/www", the Document Root will be /var/www/abcd/public.

       	* data/sessions
	* data/uploaded-files
	* public/files

    -> Allow your application to access the database by changing the settings in:
	* applications/configs/application.ini

	You should change at least three settings in this file:
		resources.db.params.username
		resources.db.params.password
		resources.db.params.dbname

	In rare cases, you may also need to change the other two 'resource' settings:
		resources.db.params.host
		resources.db.params.charset

	* In `customValues`, set the "value" column for id #1 to your agency name
	* In `users`, set the "password" column for id #1 to an MD5 hash of your admin account's chosen password.
